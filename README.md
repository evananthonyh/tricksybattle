# Tricksy Battle

This is a two-player card game implemented in Python.

# How to Run

1. Open Terminal (Mac) or Anaconda PowerShell (Windows).
2. Navigate to the folder where the script is saved. For me it is:

   cd "/Users/evan/Downloads/inst126/Consolidation Project"

3. Run the game: python tricksybattle1.py

# Game Description

- Each player is dealt 8 cards.
- They take turns drawing a card (Player 1 always leads).
- If both cards are the same suit, the higher value wins.
- If suits are different, Player 1 (lead) wins by default.
- The game runs for 8 rounds and tallies the score.

Tricksy Battle

This is a two-player card game implemented in Python.

How to Run

1. Open Terminal (Mac) or Anaconda PowerShell (Windows).
2. Navigate to the folder where the script is saved. For me it is:

   cd "/Users/evan/Downloads/inst126/Consolidation Project"

3. Run the game: python tricksybattle1.py

 Game Description

- Each player is dealt 8 cards.
- They take turns drawing a card (Player 1 always leads).
- If both cards are the same suit, the higher value wins.
- If suits are different, Player 1 (lead) wins by default.
- The game runs for 8 rounds and tallies the score.
